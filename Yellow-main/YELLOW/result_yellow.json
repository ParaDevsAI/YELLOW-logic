    "Hey TreTalat!  Great question, and you’re absolutely right: P2P removes the exchange middleman, but it introduces new challenges, especially around visibility, user protection, and compliance. That’s exactly what Yellow Network is solving.\n\nOur architecture isn’t just about P2P; it’s about Peer-to-Broker where non-custodial trades happen via trusted nodes using a protocol we call ClearSync. This design significantly reduces counterparty risk by ensuring assets are never held by centralized platforms, and settlement only happens after successful execution.\n\nUser protection? We’re on it. All trades require ",

If the trade fails, penalties apply.\n\nThe trading terminal includes latency filters, broker transparency, and security thresholds for brokers, giving users informed control.\n\nOur infrastructure is regulation-aware, built to align with future frameworks, whether it’s through permissioned layers or integrations with identity protocols.\n\nAnd yes, zk tech is on our radar. Privacy-preserving compliance is a key part of our roadmap, especially for institutions that need both privacy and auditability.

   "text": "The day before yesterday, I was talking to the marketing team, and I just don't understand why people aren't grasping why Yellow and what we've built are so important. Let me summarize it here:\nBitcoin gave us the ability to not have to trust a government to store value, or trust banks with blockchain to transfer that value. Ethereum gave us the ability to not have to trust people to execute and arbitrate contracts.\nNot having to trust third parties is the essence of Bitcoin and crypto in general. It's the very reason Bitcoin was invented and the whole movement we're a part of. But people talk about decentralization, and decentralization is just a method Satoshi devised to bring us that genius of not having to trust third parties.\nToday, the applications we write on Ethereum and all the other EVM and smart contracts don't require third parties to execute or arbitrate them. However, the applications people write on those smart contracts don't carry the essence of trustlessness. One party can be a bad actor, and the other can lose money. The Yellow SDK allows you to write applications, or yApps (an extension of dApps), that enable the integration of trustlessness between those interacting within that application. For example, a trader can interact with an online broker without trusting them. If the broker tries to defraud the trader, or if the broker gets hacked (as happened with Bybit), it doesn't matter because Yellow's mechanism ensures the trader receives their profit even if the other party acts maliciously. This applies to any trading application, but it's also expandable to video games (like Yetris) or an endless number of other applications.\nWe've given developers the ability to include that essence born with Bitcoin and Ethereum—trustlessness in third parties—into their applications. What's more, it's at a level of abstraction above any specific chain, which allows yApps written with the Yellow SDK to access any blockchain and extend the possibilities of blockchain with state channels for applications that require extreme speeds where decentralization isn't the solution, such as trading, video games, and anything else that requires the efficiency of P2P.\nI don't know how many of you will have understood this, but we are bringing a third level of abstraction of what cryptocurrencies are to the market. Just as everyone was cloning Bitcoin with things like Namecoin and what they called \"colored coins,\" when Ethereum arrived, it took out more than 90% of the ecosystem because Ethereum's abstraction made almost all those coins obsolete, and we went from \"coins\" to \"tokens.\" And now, with Yellow's abstraction over L1s and L2s, something similar could happen.\nDoes anyone understand why what we're bringing to market is so important?",
